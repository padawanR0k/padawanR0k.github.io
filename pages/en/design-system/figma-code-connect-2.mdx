Work in progress...

A helpful reference: the official Figma repository â€” https://github.com/figma/sds/blob/main/figma.config.json

### Use AI for prop mapping
If your organization has Figma's AI plan as part of an enterprise membership, you can use the feature that maps props using AI when running `npx figma connect` ([AI prop mapping](https://www.figma.com/code-connect-docs/quickstart-guide/#publish-code-connect-files:~:text=Use%20AI%20for%20prop%20mapping)).

### [importPaths](https://www.figma.com/code-connect-docs/api/config-file/#importpaths)

You can change the import paths shown in Dev Mode when `figma connect publish` makes code visible. By default it shows the hardcoded relative path in the generated `Button.figma.tsx`, for example:
```tsx
import Button from "../src/components/Button"
<Button>
    ...
</Button>
```

By adding settings in `figma.config.json`:
```json
{
  "codeConnect": {
    "importPaths": {
      "src/*": "@shared/ds-react"
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

You can change the import to:
```tsx
import Button from "@shared/ds-react"
<Button>
    ...
</Button>
```

### [imports](https://www.figma.com/code-connect-docs/api/config-file/#imports)
If `importPaths` doesn't give you the desired result, you can force an import override using the `imports` option.

```tsx
figma.connect(Button, "https://...", {
  imports: ["import { Button } from '@lib'"]
})
```

### [documentUrlSubstitutions](https://www.figma.com/code-connect-docs/api/config-file/#documenturlsubstitutions)
Reusable nodes in Figma have stable URLs. If you hardcode those URLs into generated code, any change to the node in the design can break or require code changes. `documentUrlSubstitutions` lets you treat those Figma node URLs as variables to avoid that fragility.

```json
"documentUrlSubstitutions": {
  "<FIGMA_ICONS_BASE>": "https://figma.com/design/J0KLPKXiONDRssXD1AX9Oi",
}
```

```tsx
figma.connect(Icon, '<FIGMA_ICONS_BASE>', {
  ...
})
```
